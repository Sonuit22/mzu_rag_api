Self Study Report of MIZORAM UNIVERSITY
The apathy of mainland people toward sending their wards to the University is due to the University's
lack of easy accessibility. Business houses and industries show little interest in visiting the University
for student campus placement.
Institutional Opportunity 
Located in the North-East, the University can best use the Central Government’s ‘Act East Policy’.
With more than 80% of the population in Mizoram belonging to the ST Community, the University has
a crucial role in utilizing research and developmental grants extended to socio-economically backward
classes by central govt. agencies.
The University can attract international students from neighbouring  South East Asian Countries.
Institutional Challenge 
Due to its difficulty of access from mainland India, the University needs to work hard to attract a large
number of students.
Due to the lack of education, healthcare, and other amenities, the University has long found it difficult
to retain teachers from mainland India.
Convincing business and industrial houses in mainland India to recruit for the campus is a significant
challenge, primarily due to the remote location and the associated logistical issues.
The university authority always faces a challenge in speeding up expansion activity because of the hilly
terrain and the need for transportation facilities, such as railways, for large consignments.
1.3 CRITERIA WISE SUMMARY 
Curricular Aspects 
Under the NEP-2020, Mizoram University follows a dynamic policy to revise its syllabus as often as possible
for its Post-Graduate programs. The curricula designed align with the guidelines of accrediting bodies such as
UGC, NCTE, CoA, and AICTE. They are allowed to revise the syllabus as per their suggestions/directives. The
departments deliberate and decide program/ course objectives and outcomes, draft the syllabus, and revise it
accordingly, keeping local, regional, national, and international needs and applications of the programs/ courses
in mind. While deciding the objectives and outcomes of the programs/ courses and drafting the syllabus
contents, the departments consider the model curriculum suggested by various regulatory bodies.
At Mizoram University, the IQAC collects compulsory feedback from each student before the semester-end
examination on each course. This feedback, which is a crucial part of our student-centric approach, is compiled
and circulated among all Departments. The department takes input from the feedback while revising the
syllabus next time. Courses rated below average are revised or even dropped in the next revision.
The CBCS was successfully implemented in all PG courses w.e.f. 2013-14 batch, while in UG w.e.f. 2015-16
batch. Further, PG courses were revised w.e.f. 2022-23 as per NEP-2020 guidelines, and UG syllabus revised
w.e.f. 2023-24.
Mizoram University is committed to developing a curriculum that integrates various socially relevant cross-
Page 4/101
19-09-2024 11:59:04

Self Study Report of MIZORAM UNIVERSITY
cutting issues like ethics, gender issues, disability, HIV/AIDS, human values, environment, sustainability and
inequality etc., across UG and PG programs. This approach is designed to sensitize students and shape them
into socially responsible graduates.
Every department has a compulsory course on ‘Research and Publication Ethics’ in research coursework.
Departments under the School of Earth Sciences & Natural Resource Management focus on the major thrust
areas of Environmental Pollution and management, Biodiversity, Conservation, Eco-restoration of Degraded
Ecosystems, and mitigation of frequently occurring natural calamities like earthquakes and landslides.
In addition, many Departments have been offering a variety of courses focusing on the environment and its
sustainability, including courses touching upon the concept and application of Gender issues.
Almost all the departments offer several courses focussing on Human Values and Professional Ethics in their
programmes.
Teaching-learning and Evaluation 
The pedagogical practices in the different departments of the University are conducive to facilitating the
students' learning experiences to new heights. Experiential learning is one regular learning mode where students
learn through observation and interaction with the environment during their fieldwork and excursions.
Internships or placement, job shadowing programmes and practice teaching provide the experience of applying
the principles they learned in their classes. Such hands-on training opportunities in their field of interest provide
valuable experiential learning, contributing significantly to the student's understanding of the real-world
environment.
At the University, students are not just learning, they're also reflecting on their experiences. Through written
forms, workshops, and seminars, students engage in this crucial aspect of the learning process. They also
participate in a range of extracurricular activities, both on and off-campus, and are involved in the department's
extension services. These activities not only facilitate effective learning but also help students make informed
decisions about their future careers.
Curriculum-stipulated Study Tours (CSST) and General Study Tours (GST) are regular features of all programs
that take students for short-term courses in institutes of national importance or laboratories for better exposure.
In almost all departments, learning modes include participative and collaborative learning strategies, such as
pair and group assignments, presentations, class discussions, and panel discussions.
University students actively engage with the community through events organized by NGOs related to their
fields. These participatory learning experiences not only provide students with practical skills but also foster
teamwork, leadership, and self-efficacy. The University's participation in Swachh Bharat events further
reinforces the importance of responsible living in students' experiences.
Simulated laboratory experiments and ICT-enabled teaching are used to solve technical problems in design and
architecture. Tutorials using software/hardware-based simulated training like HFSS, VLSI, PCB Fabrication,
etc., and e-learning technology through NPTEL lectures series and massive open online courses (MOOCs)
contribute greatly to effective learning.

Institutional preparedness for NEP
1. Multidisciplinary/interdisciplinary:
Mizoram University has proactively embraced the
multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary approach
promoted by the National Education Policy (NEP)
2020. To foster a well-rounded education, the
University has introduced a range of
multidisciplinary courses that encourage students to
explore subjects beyond their core disciplines.
Multidisciplinary courses have been made available
at the Undergraduate level, allowing students to gain
knowledge and skills across various fields. For
postgraduate students, 170 multidisciplinary courses
have been introduced, enabling them to gain
comprehensive knowledge from different disciplines.
2. Academic bank of credits (ABC):
Mizoram University has made significant progress in
implementing the Academic Bank of Credits (ABC)
system, which is in alignment with NEP 2020. The
University has successfully registered on the ABC
portal and established a dedicated NAD/ABC cell,
which is headed by an appointed nodal officer. This
Page 18/101
19-09-2024 11:59:04

Self Study Report of MIZORAM UNIVERSITY
Cell has been instrumental in creating a total of
23785 ABC IDs for students of Affiliated and
constituent colleges and Academic Departments of
Mizoram University, ensuring that they can
participate in the credit accumulation and transfer
process. To date, 14131 Degrees (UG & PG) have
been uploaded to the ABC portal, facilitating the
seamless integration of the credit system of all
Affiliated and constituent colleges and academic
departments at Mizoram University, as well as all
affiliated colleges where NEP 2020 has been
implemented. From the 2021 batch onwards,
academic records of students have been uploaded to
the ABC portal.
3. Skill development:
In line with NEP 2020, Mizoram University has
introduced 40 different skill enhancement courses at
the undergraduate level, available across all 40
affiliated and constituent colleges of Mizoram
University. These courses are designed to equip
students with practical skills that complement their
academic knowledge, making them more employable
and industry-ready. For postgraduate students, 118
different skill enhancement courses have been offered
across 37 Academic Departments within Mizoram
University. These courses are tailored to meet the
specific needs of students, providing them with
specialized skills essential for success in their
respective fields.
4. Appropriate integration of Indian Knowledge
system (teaching in Indian Language, culture, using
online course):
Integrating the Indian Knowledge System (IKS) into
online courses represents a significant step towards
preserving and promoting the rich heritage of India's
languages, culture, and traditional wisdom. Mizoram
University has made deliberate efforts to incorporate
IKS across various disciplines by developing and
offering online courses. These courses are designed
to deepen students' understanding of India's ancient
texts, languages, and cultural practices. By leveraging
digital platforms, we provide students access to a
wide array of resources and learning materials that
highlight the relevance of Indian languages.
Additionally, cultural courses explore India's diverse
traditions and philosophies, fostering a sense of
national pride and cultural awareness.
5. Focus on Outcome based education (OBE):
Outcome-based education is an educational approach
and a learning philosophy, focusing and organizing
the entire academic program (curriculum) and
Page 19/101
19-09-2024 11:59:04

Self Study Report of MIZORAM UNIVERSITY
instructional efforts around clearly defined
‘outcomes’ we want all the learners to demonstrate
when they complete the program. It is a student-
centric instruction model that focuses on measuring
student performances through outcomes. Further, the
outcomes express a mixture of knowledge, skills,
abilities, attitudes, and understanding, which learners
attain due to their successful engagement in a
particular higher education set. Mizoram University
follows outcome-based programs and curricula
design, including program, program-specific, and
course outcomes. The PO, PSO and CO are
extensively discussed in the appropriate academic
bodies viz., Board of Studies (BoS), School Board
(SB) and Academic Council (AC), and accordingly
displayed on the University website. The attainment
of these outcomes is quantitatively obtained with the
stakeholders, viz., students, alumni, parents etc.,
based on Bloom’s Taxonomy approach. The
attainment is again placed and discussed
appropriately in various academic bodies for further
modification/removal or introduction of suitable
courses in the curricula.
6. Distance education/online education:
The Mizoram University opens the way for learners
to attain the credits with the distance/online learning
provided by the SWAYAM (Study Webs of Active-
Learning for Young Aspiring Minds), NPTEL
(National Program on Technology Enhanced
Learning), etc., under the Ministry to Education. The
University duly adopts the regulations on SWAYAM
2016 and amendments 2021. The learners are given
the opportunity to acquire the credits under these
regulations, and credit transfer is seamlessly included
in the learner's grade card through the Examination
department of MZU. The MZU has witnessed the
success of these regulations, and more than 278
students earned 652 credits through
SWAYAM/NPTEL during the last three years of
period. During the challenging COVID lockdown
period, Mizoram University demonstrated its
adaptability and commitment to education by
leveraging its indigenous Learning Management
System (LMS) using Moodles. This system played a
significant role in providing lectures, continuous
assessment, and conducting examinations, thereby
helping us to maintain our academic calendar.

4. Quality Indicator Framework(QIF)
Criterion 1 - Curricular Aspects
   
1.1 Curriculum Design and Development
       1.1.1 
Curricula developed and implemented  have relevance to the local,  regional, national, and global
developmental needs, which  is reflected in the Programme outcomes (POs), and Course
Outcomes(COs) of the Programmes offered by the University
Response: 
Mizoram University: An example of educational excellence, Mizoram University is committed to
shaping well-rounded individuals who can thrive in a rapidly changing world. Our curricula are
meticulously crafted to meet local, regional, national, and global developmental needs. Let us delve into
the key aspects that define our approach:
Program Outcomes (POs), Programme Specific Outcomes (PSOs), and Course Outcomes (COs):
Our programs are not mere academic exercises; they are pathways to success. We emphasize clear
outcomes at various levels:
Program Outcomes (POs): These overarching goals define what graduates should achieve by
the end of their program. They encompass knowledge, skills, and attitudes.
Programme Specific Outcomes (PSOs): Tailored to each program, these outcomes focus on
specialized competencies. Whether it’s engineering, literature, or social sciences, PSOs guide our
students toward expertise.
Course Outcomes (COs): At the micro level, COs outline what learners should gain from
individual courses. These outcomes drive our teaching and assessment strategies.
Curriculum Revision and Relevance: We recognize that relevance is paramount. Therefore, our syllabi
undergo regular revisions:
Frequency: Postgraduate programs receive updates every three years, while undergraduate
programs are refreshed every five years.
Local, National, and Global Contexts: Our departments deliberate extensively, considering
local needs, national imperatives, and global trends. Whether it is sustainable agriculture or
digital marketing, our courses stay attuned.
Model Curriculum: We draw inspiration from model curricula recommended by regulatory
bodies such as UGC, NCTE, ICAR, and AICTE. These frameworks ensure alignment with
industry standards.
Student-Centric Approach:
Feedback Loop: At Mizoram University, we place a high value on our students’ voices. Before
semester-end examinations, we diligently gather comprehensive feedback on each course. This
feedback, which we consider a treasure trove of insights, plays a crucial role in our continuous

improvement process.
Continuous Improvement: At Mizoram University, we are committed to continuous
enhancement. Our departments meticulously analyze the feedback we receive from our students.
Courses that are rated below average are either revamped or, if necessary, removed altogether,
ensuring that we always offer the best possible education.
 Pioneering Initiatives:
Semester System:  Mizoram University, since its inception (2001), adopted a semester system in
all of its postgraduate courses, while a semester system for undergraduate courses is run by
constituent/ affiliated colleges w.e.f. 2011-12
Choice-Based Credit System (CBCS): Mizoram University was an early adopter of CBCS.
Since 2013-14 for postgraduate courses and 2015-16 for undergraduate courses, CBCS has
empowered our students with flexibility and interdisciplinary learning. Further, the PG courses of
all the Departments of the University were revised in the academic year 2015-16.
NEP-2020 Alignment: We stay ahead of the curve. Our postgraduate courses were recently
revised (2022-23) in line with the National Education Policy (NEP-2020), and Undergraduate
syllabi were refreshed from 2023-24 onward.
Mizoram University’s commitment to relevance, student-centricity, and innovation sets us apart. We
nurture graduates who excel academically and contribute meaningfully to society. In order to achieve the
academic standards, a robust system for revising course content is adopted, where the Departments take
input from alumni, parents, employers, and regulatory bodies. The curriculum is then revised by
involving the faculty members in the University, from the constituent/ affiliated colleges, and
distinguished academicians from other recognized institutions/ universities.

1.3 Curriculum Enrichment
       1.3.1 
Institution integrates cross-cutting issues relevant to Professional Ethics, Gender, Human Values,
Environment and Sustainability and other value framework enshrined in Sustainable Development
Goals and National Education Policy – 2020 into the Curriculum
Response: 
Amid peaceful hills, Mizoram University is committed to nurturing socially conscious and responsible
citizens. Its curriculum transcends mere academic pursuits, seamlessly integrating a tapestry of
crosscutting issues that shape well-rounded graduates. Let us delve into the key facets that define the
University:
Ethics and Values:
Recognizing that education extends beyond textbooks, every department mandates a ‘Research and
Publication Ethics’ course. Through this, students grapple with the ethical dimensions of academic
work, scholarly publications, and intellectual integrity. By instilling these principles, the University
cultivates a generation of scholars who uphold honesty, transparency, and moral responsibility.
Environmental Focus:
School of Earth Sciences & Natural Resource Management (SES & NRM) is a forerunner in addressing
environmental challenges. Its departments play pivotal roles:
1.Environmental Science: Focuses on understanding and managing environmental pollution.
2.Forestry: Biodiversity conservation and sustainable forest management take centre stage.
3.Geology: Exploring geological processes, this department sheds light on Earth’s history and its
impact on ecosystems.
4.Geography: Students unravel the intricate relationship between land, climate and society while
investigating environmental dynamics.
Collectively, these efforts contribute to eco-restoration, disaster mitigation, and sustainable resource
management. The university recognizes that environmental stewardship is not a choice but a
responsibility.
Environment and Sustainability: Beyond SES & NRM, other disciplines actively engage with
environmental issues:
1.Biotechnology, Physics, Chemistry, Botany, Zoology: These departments offer specialized
courses that delve into environmental science, sustainability, and ecological resilience.
2.Planning & Architecture: Urban planning and design principles intertwine with sustainability.
Students learn to create harmonious spaces that coexist with nature.
3.Social Work, Commerce, Management, and Economics: They address environmental

challenges differently. Sustainability is not just an ecological concern; it is an economic
imperative.
4.English, Mizo, Hindi, Education: Language, literature, and pedagogy intersect with
environmental awareness. These departments foster critical thinking about our relationship with
nature.
Gender Studies: At Mizoram University, the Women’s Studies Centre takes a comprehensive
and interdisciplinary approach to gender studies. It transcends disciplinary boundaries, delving
into how social and cultural constructs shape the experiences of women and men. This unique
approach fosters gender sensitivity, equality, and empowerment, challenging stereotypes and
dismantling barriers.
Human Values and Professional Ethics: A steadfast commitment to human values and
professional ethics lies at the heart of the University’s diverse programs- whether in science, arts,
or management. These courses act as guiding lights, leading students through the intricacies of
their chosen fields. Integrity, empathy, and responsible conduct are not just ideals, but principles
that students internalize. Whether they are analyzing data, crafting literature, or managing
organizations, our graduates emerge with a moral compass that guides them towards ethical
decision-making.
In Conclusion:
The University’s curriculum sensitizes students to critical issues- ethics, environment, gender, etc.- while
fostering a holistic understanding. As these graduates step into the world, they carry knowledge with
them and a sense of duty. They become conscientious citizens, change-makers, and custodians of a
complex yet fragile planet. University does not merely educate; it shapes compassionate leaders who
tread lightly and leave lasting footprints of positive impact.

cater to  differential learning needs of the student
Response: 
The basic concept of the CBCS-based curricula is to provide education to the learners in a student-centric
rather than teacher/teaching-centric manner. This greatly helps effectively disseminate knowledge under
continuous assessment and upgrade. During the continuous evaluation of teaching and learning, the
department teachers identify slow and advanced learners in the first few weeks of every semester. These
students are then given guidance and help in the areas where they require assistance. A teacher is
assigned to them at the beginning of the programme, and they receive some special classes and
individualized mentorship tailored to their needs, be it for the advanced learners or the slow learners, to
make them feel cared for and supported.
Special programmes are duly organized to meet the slow learners' specific needs. In this connection, the
remedial classes are arranged every semester. These include remedial classes in basic knowledge and
specific skills to bridge any gap in grasping the concepts especially in departments where entry is
multidisciplinary. Tutorial classes are conducted where students have the freedom and liberty to pose

Self Study Report of MIZORAM UNIVERSITY
queries related to their discipline, empowering them to take control of their learning. Discussions are
conducted more formally and informally with the course-in-charge. Additional classes are also conducted
to enable slow learners to be on par with their classmates.
Supplementary to the prescribed reading list, teachers provide authentic web links and materials that are
easier to understand so that the core concepts are grasped holistically first. This is done across all
departments at the university, and e-learning resources have greatly facilitated the aid rendered to slow
learners.
Group work is conducted in the classes, fields or laboratories where slow learners are paired with
advanced learners in various departments to enable peer learning. Regular seminar sessions allow slow
learners to practice their efforts and skills in a less constrained environment duly motivated by course
teachers. The student mentoring system also caters to the individual needs of slow learners, academic or
personal.
The institution also provides individual counselling by faculty professionals.
Specific needs:
Specific needs of the advanced learners are met through special programmes in the following ways:
They are constantly encouraged to follow the research journals of international repute, which are
available in the library and online through Campus Connect, as well as free Wi-Fi, which is provided
across the university. Provision is also made in many departments for advanced learners to pursue
dissertations in postgraduate programs based on their levels of learning.
Regular seminars and class presentation sessions are organized where advanced learners can hone their
skills in public speaking and presentation of research papers of higher standards. Special classes are
organized to help advanced learners face competitive examinations like the state and central civil service
examinations, NET, GATE etc. Laboratories are equipped with state-of-the-art facilities that ensure
learners, especially the advanced ones, are familiar with cutting-edge initiatives in their field. Workshops
and lectures by visiting professors are organized regularly.

2.3 Teaching- Learning Process
       2.3.1 
Student centric methods, such as experiential learning, participative learning and problem solving
methodologies are used for enhancing learning experience and teachers use ICT- enabled tools
including online resources for effective teaching and learning process
Response: 
The pedagogical practices in the different departments of the university are conducive to facilitating the
students' learning experiences to new heights. Experiential learning is one regular mode of learning
where students learn through observation and interaction with the environment during their fieldwork
and excursions. Internships or placement, job shadowing programmes and practice teaching provide the
experience of applying the principles they learned in their classes. Such hands-on training opportunities
in their field of interest provide valuable experiential learning, contributing significantly to the student's
overall understanding of the real-world environment. The students participate in various extra-curricular
activities on the campus and outside. The CSST (Curriculum stipulated Study Tour) and GST (General
Study Tours) are the core components of curricula. CSST, where students undergo short-term courses in
institutes of national importance, and GST to historical places, national laboratories, research centres and
other places.
Our students are deeply involved in the extension services of our departments, engaging in the
assessment of patients and species, and in homes, as well as those referred to us by the local community.
They also participate in evaluation and outreach programs in homes for orphanages such as Gan Sabra.
These activities not only facilitate effective learning but also expose our students to real-world issues,
helping them to make informed decisions about their future careers even before they graduate.
Participatory and collaborative learning strategies, such as pair and group assignments, presentations,
class discussions, and panel discussions, are the predominant modes of learning in our departments.
Students actively participate in small group analyses of the latest research articles in their field in the
library. They also play a crucial role in facilitating seminars, symposia, conferences, and workshops
organized by their respective departments, fostering a sense of engagement and responsibility in their
learning journey.
University students also participate in events organized by NGOs related to their fields, such as Memory
Walk on Alzheimer's Day, Mental Health Day, World Suicide Prevention Day, Poster Presentations and
participation in seminars by science students on National Science Day, etc. These participatory learning
Page 36/101

experiences also inculcate in them the skills to work in teams and, at the same time, improve students'
leadership qualities and self-efficacy. Swachh Bharat events are also an added feature to the students'
experience of living responsibly.
Besides these experiential and participatory learning experiences, other problem-solving methodologies
are also used to enhance the students' learning experience. The availability of computers with internet
connections in all the departments of the university enables the students to enjoy classrooms that involve
blended learning. Class activities with web-based online materials across the various schools differ.
Simulated lab experiments are also used to learn to solve technical problems in designs and architecture.
Our students also benefit from tutorials using software/hardware-based simulated training like HFSS,
VLSI, PCB Fabrication, and e-learning technology through the use of NPTEL lecture series and massive
open online courses (MOOCs). This exposure to cutting-edge technology greatly enhances their learning
experience and prepares them for the modern workplace. ICT is greatly enabled to facilitate teaching and
learning. All the academic departments are provided with Smart Boards, a PowerPoint system, and other
required software tools for the learners.

The institution adopts effective Mentor-Mentee Schemes to address academics and student-
psychological issues
Response: 
The university has a well-organized mentoring programme in place. Each department has a mentor-
mentee programme that caters to the needs of the students. Progress of the programme is well tracked in
the form of records and administrative files. All faculty meet their mentees as mentors for the same at
least once within a semester and more, depending upon the requirements of each student. The aspects
related to the programme are kept confidential. The mentoring program is always a structured initiative
designed to pair experienced individuals with less experienced ones to provide guidance, support and
knowledge transfer. Above other aspects, the purpose of the same is to mentor students to participate in
various technical and cultural events for their overall development. The mentees can approach their
mentors for both educational and personal guidance. The program is conducted to help the students
strengthen their varied capabilities and to build an interpersonal relationship between the faculties and
students. Mentors build student confidence and help them adjust to university life; in turn, they provide
one-on-one support and guidance to students and assist students in clarifying and prioritizing study goals.

2.6 Student Performance and Learning Outcomes
       2.6.1 
The institution has stated learning outcomes  (Program and Course outcomes)/graduate attributes
which are integrated into the assessment process and widely publicized through the website and
other documents and the attainment of the same are evaluated by the institution
Response: 
Mizoram University has introduced a new course structure and curriculum with multiple entry and exit
options, following UGC Guidelines for implementation of NEP 2020 at PG and UG levels (other than
professional and technical programmes) with effect from 2022 and 2023, respectively. Programmes run
in the University have their Program Outcomes (PO), Programme Specific Outcomes (PSO), and Course
Outcomes (CO). Every course/paper under each programme has course outcomes and objectives, the
realization of which becomes the course outcomes and is reflected in the syllabus of each course. Using
Bloom’s Taxonomy, Indigenous software is developed to obtain attainment levels using direct and
indirect assessments by stakeholders. Further, the attainment levels are analyzed and discussed in the
statutory academic bodies viz., BoS (Board of Studies) and SB (School Board) for appropriate future
actions.
The syllabus of each course under different programmes is uploaded to the University’s website, which
can be found on the page for each department. Other documents from which the institutions’ programme
and course outcomes, as well as the assessment/evaluation process, can be found are the Curriculum and
Credit Framework for Undergraduate Programmes (Incorporating NEP-2020 Recommendations) and
Mizoram University for undergraduate programmes. 
The stated learning outcomes (programme and course outcomes) or graduate attributes for different
courses under different programmes, which are integrated into the assessment process, can be clubbed as
Page 41/101

knowledge and understanding, skills required to perform and accomplish tasks, application of knowledge
and skills, generic learning outcomes, constitutional, humanistic, ethical, and moral values, employment-
ready skills, and entrepreneurship skills and mindset and credit requirements. Moreover, the attainments
of these learning outcomes are evaluated in the following ways:
Satisfaction with the calibre of the graduates
Courses are relevant to the organization’s vision and mission.
Satisfaction with the speed at which course content is being adapted to meet changing industrial
needs
Relevant subject or discipline knowledge
Quality of employability skills and attributes: Whether students have attained the required skills
is examined through project/fieldwork, laboratory work, demonstration, etc.
Application of knowledge and skills:   These are assessed in internal tests and end-semester
examinations by asking questions, the answers of which require the application of knowledge and
skills already acquired. They are also tested through practicum, lab work, demonstration, research
projects, dissertations, etc.
Generic learning outcomes: These are mainly assessed through project/field work involving data
collection and analysis, writing reports on such work, internships, community engagement,
dissertations, etc.
Constitutional, humanistic, ethical, and moral values:  These are assessed through written
tests/examinations on papers dealing with these values.  They are also tested through research
projects or dissertations.  Whether students follow ethical principles and practices in all aspects of
research and whether they avoid unethical practices such as fabrication, falsification,
misrepresentation of data or committing plagiarism shows the attainment of these attributes.
Employment-ready skills, entrepreneurship skills, and mindset:  These are assessed through
written examination, viva-voce examination, practicum, etc.
Credit requirements: Degrees are awarded to the students upon fulfilment of the required credits.

3.6 Extension Activities
       3.6.1 
Outcomes of extension activities in the neighborhood community in terms of impact and 
sensitizing the students to social issues and holistic development,  and awards received if any
during the last five years (Showcase at least four case studies to the peer team)
Response: 
Mizoram University has given utmost priority to sensitising students to social issues and holistic
development. For more than a decade, the university is actively engaged in community engagement
activities, mainly through the initiatives of the National Service Scheme (NSS), Red Ribbon Club, Eco-
club, Schools, and Departments.
1. Eco-Development project in Ailawng village
Ailawng village is a small village in Mamit district located about 24 km from Aizawl. It is one of the
four adopted villages of the NSS Unit at Mizoram University. Upon the adoption of the village and after
frequent visits and interactions with the local community leaders, it was realised that the village has a
high potential to become an eco-tourism centre. An eco-development society called Ailawng Eco-
Development Society (AVEDSOC) was created with the help of the faculty members of Mizoram
University. The University teachers and students carried out several activities to transform the quiet
village into an eco-tourism hub. These activities include – Awareness programs and on-site physical
activities to sensitise the local community towards cleanliness, tree plantation, reduction of single-use
plastics, renewal of old spring water and identification and cleaning of eco-tourism sites.

2.  Community Engagement at Tanhril 
Tanhril is the nearest neighbourhood locality of Mizoram University. It is an urban slum, and most
residents are engaged in cultivation. One of the biggest problems during the dry season in Tanhril is a
scarcity of potable water. Every year, NSS volunteers of Mizoram University engage in activities related
to water conservation, including the construction of the spring watershed, renovation and cleaning of the
watershed, and collection of plastic waste. Through these community engagement activities, students
learnt the importance of water conservation and measures to fight the declining volume of water.

3. Blood Donation
Mizoram University organises Mega Blood Donation almost every year. It was also carried out during
the COVID–19 pandemic but on a smaller scale to meet the urgent blood requirement of COVID-19
patients. From 2018 to 2023, Mizoram University students donated 824 units of blood. Blood donation is
one of the highest acts of altruism and is highly encouraged to carry on the Mizo traditional concept of
‘Tlawmngaihna’, which means selfless service to the community. Through blood donation, students

learned the importance of maintaining health and well-being. By doing this, they also played an
important role in providing awareness of the menacing problem of drug addiction and HIV/AIDS to the
public.

4. Tree plantation
Tree plantation is one of the important community engagement activities of Mizoram University. The
NSS Unit of the University has a Tree Plantation Site at Thiak Village, which the NSS volunteers visit
every year to maintain the plantation site and grow new saplings. The NSS Cell of Mizoram University
has encouraged all the affiliated colleges of MZU to create tree plantation sites to preserve the
environment and sensitise the students and the public on the importance of planting trees.

Self Study Report of MIZORAM UNIVERSITY
Mizoram University is probably the greenest and pollution free university campus in India. The green
campus initiative encompasses a holistic approach to sustainability and environmental consciousness.
The university's vision is to transform the campus into an eco-friendly environment for learners. Several
key initiatives have been implemented to achieve this vision.
1.One of the primary aspects of the MZU green campus initiative is the restricted entry of
automobiles. This measure helps reduce carbon emissions and promotes cleaner air on the
campus. We've encouraged alternative modes of transportation such as walking, cycling, and the
use of battery-powered vehicles to minimize carbon footprint. Despite being situated in a hilly
area, we've taken significant steps to implement pedestrian-friendly pathways throughout the
campus. Our commitment to safety is evident in the design of our pedestrian infrastructure, which
includes the use of ramps, staircases, and gently sloping pathways that minimize steep climbs and
ensure safety for pedestrians and cyclists alike. (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zClP9vryziHEB
D0Fd7WvN3bof5Ho1Z8Z/view?usp=drive_link ). 
2.The University celebrates Environment Day, Earth Day, etc., and ensures plantation within the
campus every year, not only for greenery but also for economically valuable plants like teak.  
3.Mizoram University promotes sustainable transportation by renting bicycles through our
incubation centre. This innovative service supports eco-friendly commuting and fosters
entrepreneurship and collaboration within our campus community. The availability of bicycles for
rent at our incubation centre encourages students, faculty, and visitors to embrace cycling as a
convenient 
and 
environmentally 
conscious 
mode 
of 
transportation.
(https://cloud.mzu.edu.in/index.php/s/gWETjDPK8mg7D3z)
4.Another crucial component of our initiative is the single-use plastic ban. We have implemented
strict policies to eliminate single-use plastics on campus, promoting eco-friendly alternatives such
as reusable containers and biodegradable materials. This initiative aligns with our commitment to
reducing 
plastic 
pollution 
and 
protecting 
the
environment. (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eNY8ZOLb_JIqKH-ZdFq-lZHEgax_jM_B/view)
5.The landscaping efforts play a vital role in enhancing the greenery of the campus. We have
incorporated extensive planting of trees, shrubs, and native plants to beautify the surroundings
and improve air quality. The campus is designed to be harmonious with nature, providing
everyone with a serene and sustainable atmosphere. Our university is nestled within a sprawling
campus with extensive greenery and meticulously maintained park areas, providing a tranquil and
scenic environment for all who study, work, or visit here. The lush green spaces and verdant
landscapes are integral to our commitment to sustainability and fostering a harmonious
relationship with nature. The university park serves as a focal point of our campus, offering a
serene retreat from the hustle and bustle of academic life. The park is meticulously maintained to
ensure its beauty and ecological value, providing a welcoming space for relaxation, recreation,
and reflection. (https://earth.google.com/earth/d/1XS3w9It8EyhzdUqn1g8WzEIaBc89s6Nc?usp=

have 
already 
been 
identified 
on 
the

washrooms are accessible by wheelchair. Both men's and women's hostels have designated Toilets for
differently-abled students in each building. Footpaths within the campus connecting department and
administrative buildings, Library and public places have tactile paths for low vision and blind students.
The Central Library set up a Braille for blind students with a designated computer and printer in a

7.2 Best Practices
       7.2.1 
Describe two best practices successfully implemented as per NAAC format provided in the
Manual.
Response: 
1. Title of the Practice:Introduction of e-Governance in the Mizoram University
2. Objectives of the Practice (100):The University is located in a remote corner of the country. It is not
easily accessible, so digital technologies help enhance the efficiency of the institution’s functioning and
allow a transparent system. Three broad objectives of e-governance are (i) to enhance efficiency and
transparency in office administrations, (ii) to facilitate the stakeholders, particularly the students,
university employees and alumni, and (iii) to facilitate the seamless and flexible teaching learning of
aspirants.
3. The Context:Implementing an e-governance project in a university setting involves addressing several
contextual features and challenges, particularly the need for Business Process Reengineering (BPR). The
existing administrative processes are often deeply rooted in traditional, paper-based workflows, leading
to inefficiencies, delays, and resistance to change. Transitioning to e-governance requires a complete
overhaul of these processes to align them with digital platforms. This includes simplifying complex
procedures, eliminating redundant steps, and ensuring interoperability across various departments.
Additionally, the challenge of managing stakeholder expectations, as faculty, staff, and students differ at
different levels, particularly towards digital literacy and comfort with newer technologies. Security and
data privacy also pose significant challenges, necessitating robust systems to protect sensitive
information. Moreover, the success of such a project relies heavily on change management strategies to
foster acceptance and ensure a smooth transition to the new, streamlined digital environment.
4. The Practice:Implementing e-governance projects in our university represents a transformative
approach to modernizing the administrative and academic functions within the institution. By digitalizing

critical areas such as finance, central library cataloguing, student admissions, enrolment, and employee
leave management, the university has taken significant steps towards enhancing efficiency, transparency,
and user experience. This practice is particularly unique and impactful in higher education in India,
where many institutions still need to grapple with traditional, paper-based processes that are often time-
consuming and prone to errors.
Adopting e-governance in our university addresses several key challenges, including the need to
streamline complex procedures, reduce administrative burdens, and improve accessibility for students,
faculty, and staff. The university's academic and administrative work automation started in 2006 with the
Finance Department and Central Library. The automation work has been extended to all aspects of the
university's functioning. The digitization of the finance module, for example, allows for real-time
tracking of budgets and expenses, leading to better financial management and greater transparency in the
university's operations. Similarly, the central library's digital cataloguing system enhances the research
and learning experience by making it easier for users to access academic resources.
The student admission and enrolment process online is another significant advancement, simplifying one
of the most critical stages in a student's academic journey. This shift reduces the reliance on physical
paperwork, minimizes errors, and speeds up the entire process, making it more convenient for both the
university and prospective students. The NAD and Digi locker of MoE, Govt. of India facility
significantly enhances the student's endeavour towards seamless and flexible learning. The digitization of
the employee leave module further contributes to operational efficiency, enabling staff to apply for leave
online and track their leave balances easily. This system also allows the administration to manage leave
records efficiently, ensuring no disruption to university operations.
The Indian higher education landscape is its holistic approach to digital transformation. The university
has embraced technology to improve administrative efficiency and enhance the overall experience for all
stakeholders. The commitment to modernizing and transparent operations through these initiatives
demonstrates a forward-thinking approach that positions the university to meet the demands of a rapidly
evolving educational environment. By overcoming traditional challenges and embracing digital solutions,
our university sets a precedent for how higher education institutions in India can achieve greater
efficiency, transparency, and accountability in their governance practices.
5. Evidence of Success:Successes of digitalisation efforts are visible in all aspects of university
functioning. Library automation facilitates the return and borrow process for the staff and the students.
With the Webopac system, the students can access 24x7 the library resources through LAN/Internet.
Examination results are declared within 15 days after the exams using the Examination ERP System.
Employees' leave is managed online, which reduces the lengthy processing time. The students greatly
benefit from the academic modules of the university management system. Online admission, online fee
payments, etc., benefit students. The academic records are accessible to the aspirants by uploading dates
on NAD, which helps the students immensely.
6. Problems Encountered and Resources Required:The implementation of e-governance faced several
challenges. A significant issue was the lack of reliable internet connectivity, mainly because the
university is in a landslide-prone area, which often disrupts communication and access to online systems.
Training stakeholders, including faculty, staff, and students, posed another challenge, as varying levels of
digital literacy created resistance to adopting newer technologies. Additionally, the existing infrastructure
could have been more adequate to support the new digital systems, requiring upgrades and maintenance
that added to the project's complexity. Integrating various modules, such as finance, library cataloguing,

and student admissions, into a cohesive platform was also tricky, given the need to align these with the
university's specific administrative processes. Furthermore, ensuring data security and privacy was a
significant concern, particularly with handling sensitive information, necessitating robust cybersecurity
measures.
7. Notes (Optional):For institutions considering the adoption of similar e-Governance practices, several
factors are crucial to ensure successful implementation. First, a thorough needs assessment must be
conducted to tailor the system to the institution's specific requirements. This includes understanding the
existing infrastructure, digital literacy levels, and the unique challenges of the geographical location.
Developing a phased implementation plan can help to manage the transition smoothly, allowing for
gradual adaptation and minimizing disruptions.
Stakeholder engagement is key—regular training sessions and workshops can help faculty, staff, and
students become comfortable with the new systems. Additionally, institutions should prioritize
cybersecurity to protect sensitive data and maintain user trust. Collaboration with technology partners
and continuous monitoring and evaluation of the system's performance are also essential to address any
issues promptly and ensure the e-governance system evolves with the institution's needs. These
considerations can guide other institutions in effectively adopting and implementing e-Governance
practices.
